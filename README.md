## Pod Worker Functionality

All the workers us the [RunPod Python Package](https://github.com/runpod/runpod-python) to implement the work functions.

## Cog

To aid in packaging, these workers referenced the [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) package to build the containers. See [cog_setup.md](docs/cog_setup.md) for more information on how to install Cog.
